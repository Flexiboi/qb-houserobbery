This version uses <b>qb-target</b> on items and storages to steal it.
</br>
Sonme items will be placed in your hand and you will have to go behind a car and place it in the trunk.
</br>
I have commented out the sneak function since it didnt 100% work
</br>
</br>
You will have to edit the loot in the config.
</br>
Might need to edit <b>ps-dispatch</b>
</br>
</br>
Items that spawn in your hand:
</br>

- TV
- LAPTOP
- LAMP
- MONEYCASE
